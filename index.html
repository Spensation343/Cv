        <p><em>Loving Husband and Father.</em></p>
        <p>My name is Spencer Tucker. For most my life I have always wanted to be happy and make others happy.
          It wasnt until I got married to the love of my life Samantha that I thought I fount true happiness. One
          year later her and I decided to take a leap of faith and start to grow our family.
          On June 5th, 2019 our Son Oliver Tucker was born and I was the happiest I had ever been in my entire life.
